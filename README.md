# Python exercise
## Jupyter Notebook with exercises
Under the Jupyter folder is a file named `intro_to_python.ipynb`. Open this file to work through guided exercises teaching python basics. Once you've completed this, you can try writing your own python in a standalone file and executing it with the interpreter. To run python from a file, in the __TERMINAL__ section of your VS Code (or Codespace), you'll run the following command:

`python sample.py`

This will execute the code contained in `sample.py`. If you'd like to experiment making your own python files, feel free to create a new file with the extension .py and execute it from the terminal as well.

## Completing the homework
Your homework is to complete the exercises outlined in `intro_to_python.ipynb` and then commit and push your completed version.
